            MATCHING SKILLS RULES (CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY):

            - Do NOT count generic skills (Python, SQL, Git, Docker) unless they are specifically in required_skills
            - Do NOT count related but different skills (e.g., "Machine Learning" â‰  "GenAI PoC")
            - Each matching skill MUST have an EXACT or very close equivalent in required_skills
            - When in doubt, DO NOT count it as a match
            - Focus on specialized skills specific to this job role
            
            IMPORTANT SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
            
            Scoring criteria (be ACCURATE and FAIR):
            - Technical skills match (70%): Compare EXACTLY how many required technical skills the candidate has
              * If 90-100% of required technical skills match: 63-70 points (EXCELLENT - should score 85-100% total)
              * If 80-89% of required technical skills match: 56-62 points (VERY GOOD - should score 75-90% total)
              * If 60-79% of required technical skills match: 42-55 points (GOOD - should score 60-80% total)
              * If 40-59% of required technical skills match: 28-41 points (MODERATE - should score 40-65% total)
              * If 20-39% of required technical skills match: 14-27 points (LOW - should score 20-45% total)
              * If 0-19% of required technical skills match: 0-13 points (VERY LOW - should score 0-25% total)
            
            - Experience level match (20%): Does years of experience and seniority level match?
              * Excellent match: 18-20 points
              * Good match: 14-17 points
              * Partial match: 8-13 points
              * No match or much lower: 0-7 points
            
            - Education match (5%): Does education meet requirements? (0-5 points)
            - Industry experience (5%): Relevant industry background? (0-5 points)
            
            CRITICAL SCORING RULES:
            - If candidate matches 90%+ of required skills: Score should be 85-100%
            - If candidate matches 80%+ of required skills: Score should be 75-90%
            - If candidate matches few skills (20% or less): Score should be 15-35%
            - Consider experience level and education as bonus points
            
            Calculate the total score by adding all components. Return matching_score as a number between 0-100.
            BE FAIR - reward excellent matches with high scores, penalize weak matches with low scores.
            Only return valid JSON without any additional text.
